# ReLaunchX - filemanager / launcher for ONYX Boox Max 

ReLaunchX is a versatile reading programs launcher and system-wide shell for Onyx Boox Max. It is a continuation of ReLaunch 1.3.8 made for Nook Simple Touch (also supported by Sony PRS-T1).
It is assumed that the user library is organized in an ordered structure of folders and files have names of books that match their names.
ReLaunchX supports flexible configuration of many on-screen buttons for quick access to certain features of the program and run third party applications.

Non-obvious possibilities:
* Some functions of the program available only with run as a desktop shell for system.
* Some functions require a device with root-access, or only implemented for Nook Simple Touch (you will receive appropriate notice).
* On-screen scrolling buttons support double click to navigate to the specified number of percents in list and long-click to quickly move to the end (beginning) of the file list. This feature often will not work properly, be careful (you need to enable it in settings).
* If you open with the button, for example, the second-to-read book, it will be after the opening of the first. Thus, you will start in round fashion two (three, etc., depending on the configuration), the last-readed books.

Note:
I aim to keep compatibility with previously supported devices however the only device on which I can run/debug the app is Onyx Boox Max as of today hence I decided to rename/rebrand the product in order to not cause any confusion.

# The tool is able to work in two modes:

### Application mode
When ReLaunch is invoked from other launcher (technically speaking when it invoked using main intent - android.intent.action.MAIN) it works in application mode.

1. filemanager
You see a directory structure, you can walk on it. Tap on directory name to go into the directory, tap on ".." labeled line to go one directory up.

2. on-file actions, single tap
When you tap on regular file (not a directory) the ReLaunch may perform a few actions, depending on you settings (see 4.)
  * call explicit package or create intent for that file if such action is defined in Settings->Associations screen
  * for .apk file - install it
  * for any other file - open viewer (if file is small enough, see 4.). Note that editor can be opened from the viewer
  * do nothing if file is too big for viewer and association for that file not found

3. on-file actions, long tap
On long tap context menu is opened. The file can be added to favorites, marked as read (we are speaking about ebooks, isn't it?) or removed (with confirmations, see 4.).
Note that directories can be removed too, even recursively. Be careful!

4. settings (first from left button on top panel)
Some application-wide settings. Pay attention to "Filter settings" and "Association".
Filter settings defines which files are visible in file manager. If you define some rules there do not forget to switch on "Filter result" checkbox in general settings section.
Association defines action which performs on file tap (according to file's extension)

5. search (second from left button on top panel
You can search files (books) from any root by some patterns. Note "Show all books" button. By pressing it you see all files with known extension (see 4.).

6. last opened files list (third from left button on top panel)
Each file opened by ReLaunch remembered in last opened files (LIFO order).

7. favorites list (fourth from left button on top panel
You can manage favorites list by adding / removing books to it.

8. about (fifth from left button on top panel)
Application info

### Launcher mode
When ReLanuch is invoked by pressing "Home" (in a NookSimpleTouch case by SoftKey "home" button), or by pressing "Nook button - > Shop" or "Nook button - > Library" it works in launcher mode. In that mode it has all standard launcher functionality (task manager / application manager) in addition to application mode possibilities described above.

Launcher mode functionality:
* Task manager (tap on memory status, first left bottom button)
* Last used applications (second left bottom button)
* All applications (third left bottom button)
  You can launch application by taping on it, or uninstall it by
  long tap (context menu opened)
* Favorites applications (fourth left bottom button)
* Battery status (tap on battery status, fifth left bottom button)
